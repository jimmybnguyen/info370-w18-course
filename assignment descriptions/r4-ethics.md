# Summary
Throughout the quarter, we've identified ethical concerns throughout the data science process. The ways in which we collect, manage, analyze, and communicate information can have various and disparate impacts on the people we study and others. In this assignment, your task is to write a Guide to Being an Ethical Data Scientist. The format you choose will be up to you, but it will need to leverage the appropriate literature, and engage the topic areas described below. In short, think about what you would like data scientists to read in order to ensure that data science is a positive and equitable force in society. 

# Topic Areas
The guide that you put together should provide sufficient information for people entering the data science field. Using at least one academic reference per topic (not just a pop-culture article), you should provide important insights for doing data science in a fair and just way. The format and order is up to you, but you'll need to include these areas (questions provided to help start your brainstorming process -- you don't need to explicitly answer them all):

Data Collection: As rising data scientists, what should people concern themselves with regarding the data collection process? What are ways in which improper data collection can lead to unethical results? How can these be avoided?

Data Wrangling: How can the manipulation, formatting, and storage of data result in unethical practices or impacts? What should someone do to avoid this?

Data Analysis: What steps can data scientists take to avoid introducing bias in their analyses? How can this be tested (and removed)?

Data Visualization: What ethical issues arise in the visualization of data? What principles should followed in order to avoid these?

# Submission / Expectations
The format of your submission is up to you. Feel free to write this using a blogging tool (Medium), word document, or Markdown. While you'll need to mention the areas described above, the specific order is up to you (feel free to be creative)! As a guide, images and diagrams may be helpful. A few guidelines:

- Length: As a guideline, we expect this to be ~600 words or more (2 - 3 pages double spaced)
- Tone: While we expect you to use academic articles, feel free to write this Guide in an easily consumable format and tone (may be academic or professional tone)
- References: We expect at least one academic article per section mentioned above, though feel free to include more references, or pop-culture articles. References should be appropriately cited based on your format (footnotes, citations, references section, etc.). We're more concerned with appropriate attribution than a specific format.
