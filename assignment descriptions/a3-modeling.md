# Overview
In the study (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. you read last week, multiple research teams tackled the same question: do referees give more red-cards to soccer players with darker skin-tones? In this assignment, you will answer the same question, and we (as a class) will evaluate the variation across teams. In doing so, you'll demonstrate the following skills:

* Programmatically generating a polished report* (using iPython Notebook or RMarkdown)
* Using libraries (pandas / dplyr) to manage and transform data structures
* Performing exploratory data analysis on a dataset
* Developing a statistical method to assess the relationship between skin-tone and receiving a red card
Defending and interpreting your statisitical approach

*Regardless of the software you use, you must generate a polished report -- there shouldn't be any unwanted code snippets, print statements, etc.*

As a pair of students, you will analyze the following questions (from the research paper):

* Research Question 1: Are soccer referees more likely to give red cards to dark skin toned players than light skin toned players?
* Research Question 2: Are soccer referees from countries high in skin-tone prejudice more likely to award red cards to dark skin toned players?

Each team of students will create a polished report using the technology of their choice, and will also fill out the following survey (link (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.) so that we can easily analyze variation in approach and results. Note, the default branch is the gh-pages branch, so your index.html file should be hosted automatically at 

# Instructions
## Set-up
For this assignment, you will build a report (PDF or HTML) that appropriately answers the research questions stated above. One team member will create their private team repository by following this link (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. Then, in the GitHub repository, they should add their partner as a collaborator (Settings > Collaborators > Add Collaborator). The repository that is created will contain a simple README.md file, as well as the dataset from the study. 

# Exploratory Data Analysis
The first section of your report will provide a detailed overview of the dataset. Using both written and visual approaches, this section will introduce the data to the reader in the context of the research questions. Be sure to provide in depth analyses of the distributions of key variables of interest. More than anything, this section should convey a nuanced understanding of the dataset being used.

# Data Preparation
Prior to performing your analysis, you will likely need to transform your data in a variety of ways. This includes, but is not limited to, creating new variables, removing observations, and aggregating (or de-aggregating) your data. Based on your desired statistical approach, you may need to create different data structures to perform your analysis. In this section, you will document changes that you make to the data structure prior to your analysis. Use visuals if/when appropriate.

# Statistical Modeling
Once you have prepared your dataset, you should create statistical models that answer the research questions stated above. In your report, you should explain your chosen statistical approach, and defend your use of method and each included variable. You may find it appropriate to use different models to answer the two research questions above. Given the nuances of the data, you may need to identify new strategies (beyond what we've covered in the course) to answer your research questions. Make sure to provide a detailed description of the method you employed, and why you chose your general approach and covariates. 

# Results 
In this section, you should present and evaluate the results of your statistical models. Using both written and visual approaches, you should express how well your models fit your data. Be sure to use appropriate statistics and visualizations to convey the results of your models and their interpretations. You should convey a nuanced understanding of the strength of relationships discovered in your models, as well as the overall accuracy of the models themselves. 

# Discussion
In the final section of your report, you should conclusively answer the research questions given your insights. Combining information from your exploratory data analysis and statistical approach, you should holistically reflect on the research questions. You should also note any limitations inherent in your strategy (all models are wrong). Finally, you should underscore the implications of your report (i.e., so what?).

# Submission
Please submit the URL of your GitHub repository to Canvas for this assignment, and make sure to fill out this survey. For easier reading of your report, your report will be hosted on GitHub via GitHub pages automatically (please provide a link to that URL in your README.md file). Because the primary branch is gh-pages, you can make your report accessible at info370a-w18.github.io/a3-TEAMNAME. If you've created a .html file, make sure to name your report index.html. For .pdf reports, you can make an index.html file to redirect to the hosted pdf as demonstrated here.

# Academic Integrity
As you know, other approaches to this research question are published on the web. You are welcome to draw inspiration from these paper, but you cannot simply replicate them. We expect the modeling approach you implement and the code you write to be your own. If your approach or code resembles an approach you find, include a link to the original source. If you have any question about the appropriate use of online resources, please ask well in advance of the due date.
