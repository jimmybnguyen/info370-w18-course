# Purpose
Academic papers provide individuals in the data science field with the opportunity to articulate the impact of their work and share their insights with others. The purpose of this assignment is to give you the opportunity to frame your work in the style of an academic (conference) paper. While it is easy to focus exclusively on the research, it is crucial to take time to format and communicate your findings to others. I expect final papers to be of excellent caliber, and hope that you consider submitting them to conferences after the course. 

# Details
The final paper should be in the style of a conference paper submission. The paper should include content that is typical of papers that appear at conferences such as IEEE Visualization, SIGGRAPH, or CHI. In particular it should contain:

- Abstract - A 150 word summary of your project and findings.
- Introduction - An explanation of the problem and the motivation for solving it.
Related Work - A description of previous papers or projects related to your project.
- Methods - A detailed explanation of the techniques and algorithms you used to solve the problem.
- Results - The major insights resulting from your research.
- Discussion - What are the implications of your results?
- Future Work - A description of how your system could be extended.

We have read papers from a number of conferences throughout the course, but if you are having trouble figuring out how to write your paper, take a look at representative papers from the conferences listed above.

Your final paper should be formatted using the 2 column formatting of papers that appear at IEEE Visualization, SIGGRAPH or CHI. Although there are some differences in format between these conferences, you are free to pick from any of these three [CHI Templates](https://chi2016.acm.org/wp/guide-to-submission-formats/)

Alternatively, if you choose to write your paper using RMarkdown, you can forego the two column formatting requirement (all sections and professional layout are still required). You may find [these templates](http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/02/svm-r-markdown-manuscript/) helpful.
