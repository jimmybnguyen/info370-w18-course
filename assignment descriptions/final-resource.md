# Summary
By the end of this course, you will be well equipped to formulate (and answer) sophisticate data driven questions. This project is your opportunity to apply the skills you've acquired to a question of interest. For this assignment, you will find (or collect) data that you can use to answer a novel quantitative question.

As an answer to your question, you will produce two products: a final paper (described here), and this online resource for a general audience, described below.

# Requirements
In addition to your final paper, you'll create on online resource to share your insights with a broader audience. How exactly you create your web-resource is up to you (interactive website with JavaScript, a Shiny App, a compiled RMarkdown webpage, etc.), but it should meet the following requirements:

- The purpose of your topic is clearly captured in your resource
- Quantitative questions are clearly and concisely explained with thoughtful text and compelling visuals
- A nuanced understanding of the important features of the dataset and topic is demonstrated.
- High-level insights (important descriptive information, major trends, notable outliers, etc.) should be prominent in your resource.
- Methods and results of statistical approaches are clear
- Your analysis should be easily reproducible using information in your GitHub repository
- Remember to tailor your resource to a specific target audience. The amount of framing you need to do for a scientific versus general audience is quite different
# Submission
Please have one member of your group submit your GitHub URL as a final resource.
